They love to eat pasta, share a dessert, and have espresso. Chloe and Kevin’s anniversary is coming up. Kevin wants to plan a night out at an Italian restaurant in town. He calls a restaurant to make a reservation but they have no tables available. He calls another restaurant, but they have no availability either. Kevin thinks and paces around the house. He knows that Chloe loves Italian food more than anything else. He knows that nothing makes her happier. But the only two Italian places in town are too busy. Kevin has an idea. What if he cooks Chloe a homemade Italian meal? Kevin pictures it: he puts down a fancy tablecloth, lights some candles, and plays romantic Italian music. Chloe loves when Kevin makes an effort. There's only one thing. Kevin isn't a good cook. In fact, Kevin is a terrible cook. When he tries to make breakfast he burns the eggs, when he tries to make lunch he screws up the salad, when he tries to make dinner even the neighbors smell how bad it is. Kevin has another idea: if he calls up one of the restaurants before Chloe gets home and orders take-out, he can serve that food instead of his bad cooking! The day arrives. Chloe is still at work while Kevin orders the food, picks it up, and brings it back home. As he lays down the place settings, lights the candles and puts the music on, Chloe walks in. "Happy Anniversary!" Kevin tells Chloe. He shows off their romantic dinner setting, smiling. Chloe looks confused. "Our anniversary is tomorrow, Kevin." Kevin pauses, looks at the calendar and realizes she's right. He looks back at her. "I guess it's always good to practice!" he says.
